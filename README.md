## Blink and Fade 

### Description

The first assignment was make an Led blink and fade. The blink part of the assignment was fairly simple all I had to do was wire the Led to power and ground then make the power go on and off. Fade was more difficult because it required a loop and variables, but I was able to figure it out in the end. 

### Evidence

#### Arduino Code

int led = 9;
int brightness = 0;
int fade = 5;

void setup() {

  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  analogWrite
  (led, brightness);
  brightness = brightness + fade;
  for (int i = 0; i < (brightness / 20); i = i + 1) {
  Serial.print("-");
  }
 
 Serial.println("");
 if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 200) {
 fade = -fade;
 }
 
 delay(5);
}

### Reflection

This Assignment was fun and fairly easy. I'm not good at coding but it was still alright. In this Assignment I learned:
* How to wire things
* Int (**Variable**)
* pinmode
* Serial.begin (**Connects to Serial Monitor**)
* analogWrite
* **For** Loop
* Serial.print
* **If** Loop
* Delay

Arduino is awesome. I found it really helpful to rename all my Sketchs.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Finite LED

### Description

This was the second assignment and was much easier than the first assignment. I was able to do it on my own! 

### Evidence

#### Arduino Code

int counter = 0;
int led = 4;

void setup() {

  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  
  counter = counter + 1;
  if(counter >= 6) {
    Serial.print("Yes");
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
  } else {
    Serial.print("No");
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);
    delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
  }
}
